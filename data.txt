BERKELEY, Calif. 
– The decades-long battle against the university over People’s Park is gaining traction once again, aided by a new initiative to make the park a Regents’ Scholar.
“I am more than ready to demolish the park,” stated UC Berkeley Chancellor Carol Christ. “But if it were to receive a Regents Scholarship. . .that would change things. Why,” she said, eyes welling, “Those Regents’ Scholars are my little sweethearts.” She sniffed. “‘Mama,’ they ask, ‘can I have early enrollment?’” Her voice trembled as she said emphatically, “Of 
course,
 sugar. And they say, ‘Mama, I want a nice double in Blackwell.’” She grabbed a tissue. “Done and done. People say I spoil them, but what my baby wants, my baby gets. It seems like just yesterday they were little freshmen trying to cut off their GBO wristbands. Oh,” she blew her nose, “How the time flies.” 
Still in support of building over the park is the director of communications for UC Berkeley’s Capital Strategies, Heim A. Dick. 
“Listen,” spat Dick, “We gotta build. Our plans for this development are fantastic. A 180-foot tall structure that makes Unit 2 look like a little bitch is just what we need to revitalize the area. And don’t worry, there’s gonna be a memorial to honor the events of 1969 and the founding of the park. After all, People’s Park is a cornerstone of Berkeley culture and community, and it’s historically linked to the Free Speech movement. So. . .  maybe a plaque or some shit? Seeing as we’re stomping all over the place, we obviously don’t care about any of that,” he said, taking a swig of coffee and spilling some on his shirt. He shook his head and chuckled. “Mondays, am I right?”
Ash Hole, a member of the project’s design team, also gave his blessing.
“We understand that there’s an entire community of folks that call People’s Park their home. It sanctuarizes various residents, serves as a community hub, and provides a space for consistent free food and clothing distribution. And because we understand that, we’re throwing in a nice little grassy area that you can do absolutely none of those activities on.” He smiled. “I hate my wife. What?” 
Unable to comment was Vice Chancellor Marc Fisher, who just had a bad nightmare and needed to go drink some warm milk in Chancellor Christ’s bed. 


BERKELEY, Calif. 
– With March comes Women’s History Month, an annual period dedicated to recognizing the inspirational role women have played throughout history. Cal fraternities are ensuring plans to honor the occasion.
“We at Sigma Alpha Epsilon absolutely love women,” stated brother Luka Dobbs. “We even have a cup formation in beer pong in their honor: ‘tight pussy’– you’re welcome, ladies. To uplift them this month, we will be hosting some parties, but as per protocol, only those who receive bids can partake. Women’s liberation is awesome, and if we as a brotherhood decide you are fuckable, then you can come celebrate that liberation with us.” 
DKE member Billy Goat elaborated further.
“Bids may seem annoying to some people, but that’s because they don’t realize how important they are. We have to enforce the bid system so that we don’t get called on by the City of Berkeley for being a ‘fire hazard,’ or for ‘endangering students’ lives.’ I’m the Risk Chair for my fraternity, and I doubt any of these women can comprehend how stressful that is.” He scoffed. “Like, if a woman decides to ‘report’ something that happened in our house, it’s on me to deal with it, which is just the worst. I have to go get a very stern talking to from IFC, so you can imagine how mentally taxing that is.” 
Goat continued, “And don’t get me started on PHC, always saying things about our ‘poor risk management practices.’ They literally need to chill. Like, we give the consent talk. What more do you want from us? To actually internalize that information? Please.” He shook his head. “Look, I’m all for throwing a party to celebrate women, I just hope they can understand all of the stuff 
we
 have to deal with to do so.”
Fellow DKE brother Josh Park shared his thoughts surrounding Women’s History Month (unprompted): 
“I love women so much. But the ones that wear showy clothing. . . I don’t know. They’re hot, yeah, but would I want to actually 
date
 one? Seems a little impure to dress so promiscuously. Personally, I find it hard to be sexually attracted to women I actually have feelings for.”
At press time, it seemed that no, no fraternity member has ever heard of the Madonna-whore complex, and yes, blondes will be guaranteed bids. 














BERKELEY, Calif. – Amidst rising concerns within California about the approach of “The Big One,” a title referring NOT to chancellor Christ’s yearly skin shedding but instead to a massive earthquake that will happen along the San Andreas fault line, scientists are turning towards Berkeley thrifters for an unlikely solution.
Seismology professor Bas Altrock said they first got the idea to look towards Berkeley’s most underground and misunderstood community from a graduate student in one of their labs. “It was just like any other Tuesday,” Altrock, who asked to be referred to as the “Doudna of rocks,” stated, “when a small earthquake struck. While myself and the rest of the class were shaken like we owed this thing money, there was one particular student who didn’t move.” This got Altrock thinking, and next thing they knew inspiration struck. “I was sitting in my car in one of the Nobel laureate parking spots, dreaming of a future where I could go there during the day and not in the dead of night when nobody would tow me, when everything came together: the earthquake didn’t want to shake that student because it didn’t want to damage their vintage Rick Owens.”
While some scientists from around the world have questioned whether Altrock knows what an earthquake is, and have brought into question the validity of Altrock’s degree from Fordham Young University, Angel Baybee, a worker at Crossroads, agreed with their conclusion. “Yeah no yeah. Little known fact, Crossroads has actually been around since before the 1906 earthquake of San Francisco. While the rest of the city was reduced to rubble, the earthquake pretty much left us alone. It saw we had a totally vintage 1800’s bonnet on display and didn’t want to ruin the vibe we were cultivating in the store so it just like… didn’t shake us.” 
Altrock wasn’t sure what their next steps should be, but they are reportedly in production for a biopic about their life starring Ira Glass. 


BERKELEY, Calif. 
– A newly-admitted student, Christina Peargate, has made quite an impression in the Class of 2025 Facebook group by boldly declaring that she enjoys going out and partying with friends, yet also appreciates a chill night staying in. 
Peargate’s post reads:
“Hey everyone!! My name is Christina Peargate, so excited to have officially decided I will be attending Berkeley with you all in the fall! I’m from Los Angeles, California, so I’m hyped to move up north. I’m majoring in MCB and hoping to live in Clark Kerr. I love reading, baking, hiking, being outside, drinking water, and breathing air. And can’t forget boba!! I also lovvee 
The Office
, so shoutout to my fellow fans with an elite sense of humor 😛 My music taste is fairly eclectic so don’t judge me lol, my top artists are Rex Orange County, Vampire Weekend, Tyler the Creator, and Arctic Monkeys. When I’m not bingeing Netflix or eating pizza, I’m spending time hanging with my friends. I do love to go out and have a good time, but I am also happy having a chill night in! Looking for a roommate so hit me up on insta @christina_peargate.”
The divisive post turned quite a few heads.
“I was just thrown by her authenticity,” shared Drew Badden. “People with the confidence to embrace their individuality like that can be intimidating. I kept my own post pretty plain, just said my name and my intended major. And then shared my views on abortion and why I’m actually Team Jacob. Nice and simple.”
Fortunately, Christina’s post seems to have spurred a connection.
“It was kind of crazy how much we had in common, so I followed her on Instagram” said Lily Sew. “Then she DM’d me to say she thought the top I wore in a post was cute. Now we’re messaging each other and we’re literally the same person! We both have siblings and we both are thinking about rushing a sorority. I think she’s going to be my best friend in college.” 
Some new students in the Class of 2025 group are stirring the pot even further, noting that they also “love to laugh with friends.” More updates to come.


BERKELEY, Calif. – Third year Rylie Brantford was spotted by friends while frantically rushing to class. She apologized for her frazzled state as she ran past, explaining she was just “over-caffeinated.”  In an exclusive interview, Rylie revealed she hasn’t had an ounce of caffeine today.
“Don’t get me wrong, I definitely drink my fair share of coffee, but that isn’t the cause of my frenzies. Rather, it’s the perpetual academic and social strife pervading campus that breeds mental instability. But hey, at least I get mediocre smoothie recipes from Berkeley Student Well-Being newsletters. The pumpkin spice quinoa shake has done wonders for my gut health, so this morning I decided against capping it off with three shots of cold brew.” 
Brantford continued on. 
“I’m just so used to drinking copious amounts of the bean’s elixir every day that I assumed it was the cause of my mental instability. Interestingly enough, I replaced my usual two cups of coffee with a delectable butternut squash smoothie that definitely didn’t taste like baby food and somehow my anxiety persisted. It’s so weird! It’s almost as if my reliance on caffeine as a ritualistic source of energy just functioned as something which gave me a sense of control allowing me to ignore the larger mental health issues I have.”
Responding to the situation, Rylie’s housemate Sara Kissinger explained how she handles stress on campus. 
“Listen. I know there are apparently some people out there who can’t handle 28 units, but that’s not me. I am actually doing totally fine. Everything is under control and life is a breeze. I haven’t even shit myself today. You know that I’m doing fine, right? Say I’m doing fine. I’m fine. I’m actually great. Like truly everything is great and I am doing great.” Avoiding further comment, Sara abruptly left to replenish her supply of coffee. 
At press time, Sara was seen leaving GBC holding two large iced lattes and a roll of toilet paper while sprinting down Sproul.



On 04-04-2022 08:30:00, I looked hot outside Doe Library.
At approximately 09:25:00, I arrived at Doe Library to meet up with my study group. They hadn’t seen me since I got my hair braided by a kindly old woman on the beach of Cancun. To put it plainly, I was giving major cunt. People’s heads were turning. After leaving Doe Library, the suspect (me) headed to a second location (Yalis) with an unknown motive (to be perceived by even hotter people).

Timely warnings are released by the University of California Police Department when I see they left their account logged in. These timely warnings provide information about campus safety, and allow less dripped out community members to take precautions. The reported information has been investigated and confirmed at the time of the issuance of the warning, by my old Tinder match who swiped up on my instagram story with the fire reaction.
Physical descriptions of a suspect, including how good my newly braided hair looks, are included in timely warnings only when they provide several details that might help distinguish the suspect’s appearance from the general population, though in this case you’ll be able to tell because I just look better than everybody else.




The 2008 animated Pixar film, 
WALL-E
, might be a severe societal criticism of capitalism, corporatocracy, environmental degradation, and global catastrophic risk, but above all: it’s a love story.
The protagonist we all know and love, WALL-E, is a dumpy trash-compactor that looks vaguely like a set of binoculars attached to a cardboard box. He lives in a truck, his best friend is a cockroach named Hal, and he has a concerning hoarding problem. 
EVE, the love interest, is a sleek, foxy probe
—
surprisingly feminine despite a lack of cartoon boobs— 
that strongly resembles a bullet vibrator. When WALL-E first lays eyes on her tempting figure, he practically wets himself. But EVE is not having it; she’s too busy signaling her main starship about some little plant she found that might indicate Earth is finally inhabitable after years of being toxified by mass consumerism, or whatever. 
When EVE is whisked away to the starship, WALL-E follows her, obviously desperate for some action after spending 700 years as a virgin planet-janitor. But EVE has more important things on her mind, like getting the plant to the ship’s captain and returning the human race to Earth, consequently rebelling against the status-quo of the disconnected, digitized life aboard the ship and returning a sense of humanity to the world. WALL-E, that horny motherfucker, doesn’t care and only wants to hold hands.
Though WALL-E just can’t keep that perverted little mind of his at bay, don’t worry, because eventually, EVE returns the sentiment. 
After everyone returns to Earth, the two share a little electric shock that is meant to be a kiss. First base for WALL-E! 
But then, all of their robot friends are ushered away to give them some privacy!! And if that’s not a clear sign they’re about to bang it out, I don’t know what is. WALL-E, mazel tov. You made it.
Fellas, I’m sure you’ve all gone to great lengths for some pussy, like saying you listen to Clairo, looking up your birth chart, or maybe pretending you think women deserve rights. But WALL-E traversed through the cold, meaningless vacuum of space, all for EVE’s Jiffy Lube-cooch. Beat that.



BERKELEY, Calif.— “We finally did it!” The heads of Cal Zero Waste 2020 have declared victory. Zero waste has finally been achieved. 
I recently had the privilege of interviewing the leaders of Cal Zero Waste 2020. “We always thought that by doing very little and pushing the zero waste deadline back a year the problem would solve itself. Turns out we were right.”
I asked them how the club ultimately achieved its long-time goal. “It was honestly really simple,” they said. “At a club meeting, we were discussing how we could promote Cal Zero Waste when we had an epiphany. If Cal Zero Waste introduced COVID-19 to Cal, the university would probably shut down and send all the students home. And we don’t want to brag or anything, but we were totally right.”
“By having all the students move back home Cal’s waste shrunk drastically. In terms of reducing food waste, our strategy of preventing people from being able to eat at the dining halls has been remarkably effective. Additionally, with all the students gone, people aren’t mixing up which bin to put their trash in anymore. The university’s electric bill is at an all-time low along with the school’s heat bill. We couldn’t be happier here at Cal Zero Waste 2020.”
I was wondering how zero waste would be sustained when the students came back. The leaders explained the club’s plans for UC Berkeley’s future. “You’re right,” they told me. “If students moved back to campus, our waste would shoot back up. That’s why we created a change.org petition to have Berkeley stay permanently online. Our endgame is to destroy all the campus buildings and replace them with redwood trees. A tree is much more sustainable and far better for the environment than a building. People always say Evans is ugly. Let’s convert it to something beautiful that’s actually good for the planet.” 
They told me that Cal Zero Waste 2020’s dream is to make Berkeley the #1 public online university in America. “The University of Phoenix and ABCmouse.com don’t know what’s coming for them.”


BERKELEY, Calif. 
– The vegan student cooperative house prepared an excellent meal the other night consisting of a quinoa salad appetizer and a quinoa bean chili, all accompanied by a side of quinoa. Also, whip-its. 
“Clean eating is so important, not just for the Earth, but for your health as well,” explained junior co-op resident Arugula Sausage as she shoveled some quinoa off her plate. “Veganism helps me fuel my body with delicious, plant-based, locally-sourced, all-organic foods and nutrients. Our bodies are our temples,” she declared, grabbing a whip-it canister, “and we need to treat them as such.” She inhaled. “
Fuck
 yes.” 
Fellow resident Jiminy Cricket had more to add.
“It’s just really important to maintain a sustainable mode of consumption,” he shared, “especially amidst the toxicity of capitalism. All we do is take and take and take, and the exorbitant amount of waste we produce is honestly disgusting. If you’re not gonna make an effort to reduce what you consume, then frankly, you can fuck off.” He shook his head and walked over to dump his leftover quinoa in the compost bin that sat right next to a trash can overflowing with used whip-its. 
River Smith (real name Brian), helped himself to a second serving of quinoa and stated, “People probably have a lot of inaccurate and hurtful stereotypes regarding a vegan-centric co-op. But at the end of the day, we’re just like-minded, down-to-earth people that all have the same goal in mind: to enjoy a sustainable, 
healthy
 lifestyle.” 
He made his way over to a table and announced, “Let’s all take a second to appreciate Mother Earth and all of the incredible food she blesses us with. This planet, this divine energy, gives so much. And us? We’re just simple organisms, suckling the pure life that flows from her warm bosom.” He paused, gazing adoringly at his quinoa. “Now,” he continued. “Who’s down to do whip-its after dinner tonight?” The dining room erupted in cheers.
A City of Berkeley Refuse Collection Services staff member wanted to note that they are not only unhappy with the amount of whip-its in the co-op’s trash, but they’ve also noticed the enormous heaps of empty hemp milk containers, and are, honestly, getting concerned.


BERKELEY, Calif. – After years of begging for disability accommodations, campus super-senior Ash Jensen was miraculously cured of their chronic illness when their philosophy professor proclaimed that they were not actually disabled.
“It was an act of God,” said classmate Gina Aguilar. “As soon as those words fell from Professor Singer’s mouth, Ash started glowing like the sun. When it was over, Ash looked exactly the same, but their chronic pain was suddenly gone! They must be really thankful to Singer for showing them the truth about their illness.”
In his modesty, Professor Singer claimed he didn’t even do anything.
“I mean, like I said, Jensen wasn’t even disabled in the first place,” Singer conceded. “He [
sic
] doesn’t use a wheelchair or a cane or anything, but he [
sic
] still has one of the best grades in the class 
without
 any of those freebie accommodations. I can tell from personal experience when someone’s disabled — I have a friend whose brother’s wife’s cousin broke his leg and needed to use a wheelchair once. Disabilities that other people can’t see are all just from a negative mindset, and I just forced Jensen to face the facts.”
Jensen, on the other hand, was not appreciative of this turn of events.
“First of all, why did it take you so long to interview 
me
, the person that this actually happened to?” they groused. “Second, why does everyone think I 
want
 to be cured? Yeah, it was nice at first to not have to deal with the pain, fatigue, and hordes of people giving me advice on how to improve my health, but I feel like I’ve lost part of my identity — what if I was ‘cured’ of being genderfluid? God, I can’t believe people are celebrating this!”
A few minutes later, Jensen, too, was seen celebrating their new ability to jump onstage and slap Professor Singer when he cracked an ableist joke.


BERKELEY, Calif. – Nihilists and religious skeptics of all stripes were in for a shock yesterday morning when God (pronouns unpronounceable by mortal mouths) appeared on Sproul Plaza carrying a pack of string cheese and a quart of Lucerne™  5% Reduced Fat Milk.
“I couldn’t believe it,” remarked junior Holden Kim, who was flyering for his United Methodist Church at the time. “One moment, I was trying to convince this disinterested freshman to join our congregation for Sunday worship and KBBQ; the next, I was standing before The Lord Almighty Himself! Too bad The Lord didn’t want to join us for Sunday worship, either.”
Sophomore Amanda Cartman noted that the sight of God helped revive her dwindling belief in the higher powers.
“I’m a devout Catholic,” Cartman explained, “but I have to admit, the last few years have really tested my faith. I mean, two of my grandparents passed away from COVID, then my dad caught it and barely survived, then my house burned down in a wildfire, and now apparently I can’t show up to class in my underwear anymore? It’s all been quite a struggle, to be honest, but at least now I know that the reason all those terrible things happened to me is because God was out shopping and not because I’m completely alone in the universe with no definitive purpose and nothing to look forward to other than the sweet release of death.” 
“Yeah, I really didn’t think it was that big of a deal,” said God, who would prefer to be left the fuck alone. “All I did was dip off to Trader Joe’s to get some cheese and skim milk, and the next thing you know, everyone’s screaming at me like I abandoned them or something. Pandemic! Climate Change! Riots! Shootings! God is dead! Like, I get that the past few years have been tough or whatever, but it’s not like I released the Ten Plagues of Egypt or tried to wipe you all out with a massive flood. Compared to some of the shit I’ve pulled in the past, 2020 was fucking tame.”
In spite of God’s literal, physical manifestation on Sproul, many of His doubters remain unconvinced of his existence.
“If God is real,” began renowned logician and meme inventor Dickhard Rawskins, “why hasn’t he given me the Limited Edition Ultra Rare Pyrus Bakugan I’ve been praying for since third grade? He didn’t give it to me then, and he isn’t giving it to me now, so clearly he is either not real, or a real bitch.”
After consulting with the acclaimed atheist intelligentsia on Sproul Plaza, God admitted that He found many of their arguments compelling.
“I got to wondering: why 
do 
I let bad things happen to good people? In fact, why do I let bad things happen at all?” God shrugged and took a fat, contemplative bite from His unstringed cheese stick. “I used to rely on Descartes’ ‘I think therefore I am’ reasoning to prove my existence to myself, but I honestly can’t remember the last time I adequately thought through something before doing it. I mean, just the other day, I gave this innocent little girl Münchmeyer disease for absolutely no reason, no fucking reason at all. Do I ever think about anything? Am I even real?” He shook His head and stared off into the staple-ridden bulletin board. “These atheists might be on to something.”
At press time, God was last spotted in Doe Library, drinking furiously from His milk jug while poring over the works of Nietzsche and Foucault. As to how He got His hands on a jug of 5% milk, sources report that the Lord works in mysterious ways.













BERKELEY, Calif. — Peter Johnson has been awarded a Regents Scholarship after eating an entire  whopping, enormous, fat slice from Artichoke’s Pizza using only a singular plate. He recounted the life-changing experience.
“I’ve been eating at Artichoke’s for years. I’ve always questioned why they serve their slices on two plates. I know they’re big, but I’ve had a gut instinct for a while — actually, to be honest, I’ve had a gut instinct since the first time they ever served me — that I could manage to eat a slice using just one plate. As a Society and Environment Major in the College of Natural Resources, I’m always thinking of ways to help the environment. Eating a slice from Artichoke’s off of one paper plate would be a step towards saving the Earth. So I asked the manager if I could have my Margherita slice on one plate.”
The manager was caught off guard. He was, overall, very nervous for Peter. 
“At Artichoke’s we serve big, generous, slices. Because of this, we feel comfortable charging over $5 for a slice, even though that is more expensive than literally any other individual slice in the entire continental United States. I was concerned the tip of Peter’s slice would touch whatever he put the plate down on. But, at the end of the day, the customer is always right, so I let Peter have the slice on one plate.”
Peter left Artichoke’s and continued to walk down Durant when he bumped into Carol Christ. 
“She saw me eating the slice and her jaw completely dropped. It was like someone had found Berkelium all over again. I explained that I was eating off of one plate to help reduce forest fires. She was blown away. The Chancellor commemorated me for my effort to mitigate climate change and awarded me a Regents Scholarship. I hope this can be a source of inspiration to my fellow peers.”
Next year, Peter is looking forward to laughing at his friends’ awful apartments from his Blackwell single.


Like many of the other quarantined Cal students, Christine Waters had spent many nights missing campus. She was handling the break-up pretty well for a while, until UCBWarnMe started hitting her up late at night.
“I’ve been trying to keep busy since online classes started. It was tough initially. I had to tell myself that it’s okay to be sad, and that I need to accept that in-person classes are over. I thought I was doing well, but then UCBWarnMe starts lighting my phone up. I hadn’t thought about UCB in weeks, but once they texted me I started to break down. All it took was this simple message: 
Berkeley Fire Department and police responding for a fire at People’s Park. AVOID THE AREA until further notice
 and out of nowhere, I became overwhelmed with nostalgia for those good-ole dangerous times. I started spiraling, thinking of the days when I used to twiddle with my neon-pink pepper spray while walking down frat row. My mind just jumped to those nights when I had to nervous-walk in a pack back to my apartment, surrounded by people who could collectively fend off a mugger. UCB sent me one text and my self-defense mechanisms completely shattered. I just broke down missing that glorious Berkeley atmosphere of danger. I don’t have Stockholm Syndrome, do I?”
When asked why it had been so challenging to get over UCB, Christine explained the struggles of fully mentally parting with UCB. 
“It is incredibly tough to get over someone like UCB. They always have been there for me. They always let me know when there is traffic or road closures. If someone is stealing laptops from Strada at gunpoint, they let me know to avoid the area. UCB really cared about my safety and wanted what was best for me. But, now since I’m back home in LA*
, it just doesn’t make sense to stay with UCB anymore. Long-distance never works and isn’t practical.”
Luckily, time heals all wounds. Christine has recently rebounded with Wildfire. 
“Thank gosh I remembered about Wildfire. Wildfire is perfect for me. I’ve been spending hours during lectures texting them. They have been helping me forget about UCB and move on.”
At press time Christine was on the rebound with Wildfire. However, she is slightly concerned that Wildfire is basically just UCBWarnMe, and is questioning if she is handling her parting with UCB in a healthy way. 
Clarification of where Christine lives: Technically, she doesn’t live in LA. She lives pretty close to LA so she feels justified telling everyone she’s from LA. She doesn’t believe anyone would recognize the name of where she’s actually from, even though they probably would. The idea that if someone didn’t recognize the name they could just ask “Where’s that near?” has never crossed Christine’s mind. Christine also thinks LA is way cooler than where she’s actually from so she just says she’s from LA.



Hey guys, super embarrassing but… I know it’s been 10 years since 
Kony 2012
 and my memory is just not what it used to be – did we do something about that?
I mean do you even remember who Kony is? Like some snow cone mascot? A traffic cone spokesperson? Why 2012? Was he in LMFAO? Did he sing Gangnam Style?
What was that all about anyway? The Presidential election is a little too obvious; what else happened in 2012? Was Kony the Republican incumbent that year? Maybe it was about that really shitty movie 2012, I’m pretty sure you could convince me that some guy named Kony was in it. Or maybe produced it? Or maybe watched it? I’m at my wits end. 
How come he gets to have a number with his name? Who are the 2,011 other Konys? I mean I’m jealous; I too want to have the same name as 2,011 of my best friends – just like girls named Emily in Greek life. 
Was Kony someone I just knew personally? I have a shirt that says “Kony 2012” for some reason but I’m scared to wear it out in public in case it aged poorly. Why did Kony spring for Gildan? Is he a 17 year old starting a streetwear brand? 
Kony 2012 – I know that name… maybe he was my AYSO coach? But not the cool one who brought orange slices, he was the one who set up the cones – that’s why he’s Kony! 
Were the 2012 Olympics held in some place called Kony? Oh maybe that island in New York – wait, is 
he
 that island in New York? Did something big happen there in 2012? Did someone just write it as “Kony” instead of Coney and now we’ve Mandela Effect-ed ourselves into believing that’s how it’s always been? 
Is that the year Joey Chestnut won his first title at Coney Island? 
Maybe the real Kony 2012 is the friends we made along the way… 🙂 No wait that’s stupid, I think the real Kony 2012 was killed and replaced with a fake – I mean just listen to “Kony Fields Forever.” 


BERKELEY, C
alif. – Worried about the lack of plays on his most recent tracks, local SoundCloud rapper Lil Big Penis has turned to the piano on Sproul in an effort to gain fame. 
“I’ve been spending a lot of time in the studio,” stated Lil Big Penis, before quietly clarifying that “the studio” is his bedroom. “My mixtape, ‘Lil Me, Big World,’ is the outcome of a deeply challenging creative process that, while extremely inspiring, was also very time consuming, taking me practically three days to make. But then it only got 13 plays on SoundCloud, which is rigged because it deserves to be platinum. I knew I needed a new outlet to really promote my music.”
Unfortunately, the piano is frequently occupied, either by weird old white men or by Berkeley students wanting to show off their impressive rendition of “Heart and Soul.” Lil Big Penis persevered, however, reporting that he used a speaker to play his beats while standing by the piano and rapping. 
The expanse of Sproul plaza was soon filled with his poetic lyrics, such as this sample from his piece, “Uncircumcised”: “Yo, yo, it’s Lil Big Penis, uh / You know I’m the meanest, uh / Just had sex with your mom / Are we sure that 5 inches is average because that seems like an overshoot haha ha ha.” Or his song, “My Girl”: “Juicy, juicy, juicy, juicy, juicy, juicy, juicy, juicy, juicy, juicy, juicy, juicy, juicy, juicy, juicy, juicy, juicy, juicy, juicy / Titties.” The mumbled lyrics were often hard to discern from the harsh, boxy beat that was composed purely through GarageBand, but Lil Big Penis seemed to be extremely proud of his “flow.” 
While demonstrating his recording process, which is just the iPhone Voice Memos app, Lil Big Penis’s phone started ringing with an incoming call from the contact, “Madre.” He answered the phone but quickly began to protest that he was too busy to talk, being very preoccupied with editing some new beats for a huge upcoming project. 
On the other line, his mom sighed deeply. “David. Give it a rest.”
Music is Lil Big Penis’s passion, but for now, he’s a Media Studies major. 


BERKELEY, Calif. — Recent reports from CalCentral confirm that, as of last Friday, the waitlist for UGBA 69 (“Deep-Throating Oski’s Massive Cock”) has grown to nearly triple the size of class capacity, much to the dismay of many up-and-coming-turned-down-and-sucking Haas majors.
“There’s no sense in beating around the bush: in business, you gotta give head to get ahead,” said newly-enrolled student James Jameson as he went down on the Golden Bear’s golden schlong. “That’s why I — 
*slurp*
 — am so glad —  
*slurp*
 — that I finally — 
*slurp* *aaah*
 — got into this class.
Unlike those worthless plebs who are still on the waitlist, I’ll be fully prepared to suck my way up the corporate ladder. Today, it’s just Oski, but tomorrow it’ll be Jeff Bezos, or Mark Zuckerberg, or who knows, maybe even Elon M-” Jameson continued before he was cut off by the Golden Bear’s golden load tumbling down his esophagus.
Campus administrators have expressed shock at the incredibly high demand for UGBA 69.
“Honestly, we had no idea the course would be this popular,” explained Ann Harrison, Dean of the Haas School of Business. “Even though we know exactly how many students are in Haas and UGBA 69 is a prerequisite for basically every other course in our program, it was inconceivable that so many students would apply. Unfortunately, since Oski only has one cock, we can only admit so many students at a time. Those on the waitlist will simply have to pray that someone currently enrolled in the class just really, really sucks at sucking dick.”
UGBA 69, while technically a business course, is actually quite popular across majors. Many students are attracted by the course’s ability to simultaneously satisfy breadth, length, and girth requirements, while others are simply interested in the rock-hard course material.
“Hell yeah, I wanna suck Oski’s cock!” exclaimed DKE pledge and #345 on the waitlist Chad McKroeger, before randomly blurting “no homo tho. It isn’t gay if it’s bestiality. I just think Oski is such an icon, it would be an honor to have his cum tattooed on the inside of my throat, whether or not I get credits for it.”
Some students are less enthusiastic about spending quality time with Cal’s ursine mascot.
“Really, the whole thing blows,” said #669 Alfred Ascot III. “I mean, an entire course on sucking dick, and the only dick we get to suck is Oski’s? Seriously? The networking opportunities are nonexistent. Any course worth its salt would at least hook us up with the founders of Theranos, Solyndra, Cambridge-Analytica, or some other innovative, ground-breaking company. Hell, we could at least get to work with more of the 3” CEO standard instead of this 14” monster. But no, this is Cal, so all we get is Carol Christ’s sloppy seconds.”
At press time, several desperate waitlisted business students were caught on Sproul Plaza offering free blow-jobs to anyone with more than 50 connections on LinkedIn.


War. Wealth Inequality. Broken McDonalds ice cream machines. These issues pale in comparison to the true tragedy of the 21st century, the fact that I am currently single. 
First, the facts. My grandmother reported in a public forum (family dinner at Chili’s after my high school graduation) that I am “a very handsome boy.” If this unbiased source (a 5’2” 75-year-old Telugu woman whose only grandson is me) made such a statement to the North American public at large, we can assume it’s fact. As we all know, all women have the exact same taste in men and are an invariable monolith. Now that I think about it, I think her exact words were that I was her “most handsome grandson” and then she laughed after as if making a joke but that’s not important. “Tomato, potato” as the saying goes. 
We’ve established that I am factually “a catch.” So that begs the question: what is wrong with society? Let’s take a look at a recent date I went on. As usual, I greeted my date wearing an 18-piece bright neon green tuxedo. I reassured her that the outfit was from a “different thing” that I wasn’t legally allowed to talk about.” Instantly, it made me seem mysterious and fancy, but she didn’t care. She suddenly lost interest in me and booked it back to her apartment.
On my last date before that, I took her to my go-to spot (a UC Berkeley prospective student tour). I worked my magic (frequently interjecting “owie owie, my little piglets hurt from walking so much with these size 6 dress shoes. Can you please slow down for Pete’s Sake?”). At the end of that date, she asked me if I wanted to come up. And honestly? How 
dare 
she. She wanted me to spend several hours peeling off each layer of my tuxedo without offering directions to the nearest dry cleaning service. I try, but jeez louise, maybe chivalry really is dead. 
Clearly, the issue is that women these days simply do not appreciate the efforts of totally normal well-adjusted men like myself.




BERKELEY, Calif. 
– After plans for an in-person Fall 2021 semester were announced, acapella groups across UC Berkeley rejoiced at the prospect of once again being able to perform for, and be overlooked by, the masses on Sproul Plaza.
“It’ll be so nice to finally go back to playing live,” said a smiling Julia Trombone, member of the UC Women’s A Cappella Group. “It’s just not the same over Zoom! Now, is it a shame that the beauty of the genre goes unrecognized? Yes!” Her laughter tinkled through the air. “Is it disgraceful that no one appreciates our performances the way that we deserve?” Her smile hardened. “Yes.” A pause. “But I’m just so excited to finally be back!” 
Berkeley’s acapella groups aren’t the only ones delighted by an in-person Fall 2021. Lucifer Diablo, event coordinator of Sproul Plaza, also shared his enthusiasm.
“Sproul has been so empty and lonely compared to the vibrant spot it used to be, and Hell, I’ve missed it! But don’t worry,” he assured. “Soon enough, the plaza will be filled, with tables staffed by overworked students lining its contours, little flyers for events that no one will ever go to being constantly passed around, various protests happening here and there to remind students just how fucked up the world is and just how helpless they are to truly do anything about it, even the occasional presence of a Christian guitarist to add in some level of irony to the whole thing.” 
Mr. Diablo took off his hat, grinning darkly as the tips of what looked like horns peeked through his hair.
“The large population of Berkeley students that suffer from social anxiety will finally have to go back to their daily struggles trying to avoid Sproul. Or,” he grew breathless, shadows dancing around him, “Better yet. They’ll finally realize they simply can’t avoid it, and will have no choice but to walk through the messy crowd and overthink their every move, screaming inwardly as they desperately avert the eyes of their flyering peers and the swarm around them. Oh, yes.” The air felt hot. “Sproul will once again be the anarchistic, overcrowded, cacophonous mess it used to be!” Behind him, a recycling bin caught on fire. He didn’t turn to look.
Thrilled by the social implications of an in-person semester are the Cal fraternities, as none of them have been permitted to hold any social gatherings due to Covid-19. 
“What? Oh- oh. Yeah. Uh. It’ll be super cool to have in-person parties again,” said KA junior Brock Vanderson. “I sure have missed them. Yep. No one’s been coming over all semester. It totally sucksss.” 


LONDON, United Kingdom – On Thursday, members of the British government 
were saddened to learn about the loss of a revenue stream also known as Queen Elizabeth II. Official reports state that she died peacefully in her bed, however staff in the castle, who are coincidentally all members of former British colonies, report that they heard the sound of “a portal or gate opening” followed by the “clinking of bones and the swishing of a scythe” as Elizabeth disappeared in a cloud of brimstone and those mentos that every old white woman keeps in her purse.
News of Elizabeth’s passing has been especially upsetting to curators and collectors working for The British Museum in London, England. In an exclusive press release from John Bonaparte III, the current department head of the 
Egypt and Sudan
 section of the infamous museum, Bonaparte stated: “The reaction by the public to Betty’s death is extremely disturbing to anyone with an ounce of moral character.” Upon hearing that Elizabeth’s corpse had been removed from the grounds of Windsor Castle, Bonaparte added that “The British Museum wholeheartedly stands against the wrongful dispossession of Betty. She has a cultural importance to the castle, and she should stay there!” Bonaparte delivered this statement while sitting cross legged atop a sarcophagus, which the museum has been using as a stepladder to put up bathroom signs. 
Heads of other departments within the British Museum have also weighed in on the recent passing of Elizabeth. Mark Whitebread, who has run the
 Middle East
 division since 2011, explained to news reporters that “this has really been a wake up call for our museum. If we as Britons are sad about Elizabeth’s passing, that could mean that other people are sad when we take the bones of their ancestors. That’s called [Whitebread then took a long pause to read something from his hand] telepathy.” We believe Whitebread meant empathy, but honestly your guess is as good as ours.


BERKELEY, C
alif. –  Following their recent vaccine announcement, FIJI brother Brandon Dix took a risk and invested in Pfizer despite the various warnings and conspiracies on his Facebook timeline.
“I haven’t been blinded by the lying media, so I know that the vaccine is bullshit. But I also know a good investment when I see one,” he stated. “Lots of Americans think that the vaccine is a good thing, so Pfizer is gonna be huge. But it’s honestly embarrassing how easily manipulated these people are, just believing everything they see on the news. They need to wake up and realize that the vaccine is actually a government scam that’s been created to control us, and I know that because it said so on my ‘White Lives Matter’ Facebook group.”
After commenting, “Hey lol,” on Charli D’Amelio’s Instagram post and only pretending to delete it when his friend reminded him she’s a minor, Dix continued on.
“First quarantine, then masks – it’s like what is this, America or a tyranny? I have the freedom to refuse a vaccine. My body, my choice,” he declared, adjusting the Trump flag hanging on his wall. “I just have zero respect for a government that refuses to recognize the democratic rights of its citizens.”
Dix isn’t the only one eyeing the market right now. Jackson Fielding, a sophomore who is currently working on his Haas application and making sure everyone knows that, has also chosen to invest in Pfizer. 
“It’s a very sound investment,” said Fielding. “I mean, Pfizer is gonna be sending vaccines out and people will be demanding those babies left and right. And you know how it is with the law of supply and demand,” he chuckled, glancing at a failed Econ quiz sitting on his desk and quickly flipping it over. “Anyways, I haven’t had a ton of time to focus on my investments right now since I’ve been pretty busy working on my Haas application.”
Scam or not, the Pfizer vaccine has been very positively received by college students across the nation, who are reportedly so excited by the prospect of things going back to normal that they’re going out to party and celebrate.

Student loan and I go way back. We met at the end of my senior year of high school, and at first, everything was picture perfect. I fondly remember all the times we would hang out on a lazy Sunday afternoon in my parent’s garage: she would get me drunk on 
vino
, we’d put on a 
Friends
 rerun, and then she’d ask me to sign some really lengthy documents she told me I didn’t need to read. She was just a free spirit, I told myself. And maybe she had one of those portable printers.
Student Loan was the kind of girl people gravitated to, the kind of girl who always seemed to be there when times were toughest. She was one of those people who went by their full name. Elton John. Student Loan. Doja Cat. She just fit in with that crowd. To put it plainly, she was a celebrity. Everybody knew her, everybody relied on her. On top of that, she had a huge online presence and was so politically active; even president Biden couldn’t keep her name out of his mouth. 
Because of her I made lifelong friends, was allowed to push myself academically, and was finally able to move out of my parent’s house and into a new city. Sure, there were some red flags. But as I’ve always said, when you look at someone through rose colored glasses, all the red flags just look like flags. People would ask me things like, “How can a human girl be friends with an economic construct?” But that didn’t matter to us. That didn’t matter to her. At least that’s what she told me. 
As soon as I graduated, she became a whole different person. She was no longer as flushed with cash as she first made herself out to be. In fact, she started demanding large sums from me, more than I had ever even borrowed from her. She wouldn’t leave me alone, sending crazed emails to me and my family members and calling me drunk at all times of the day. She told me even if I was bankrupt, with nothing but my hopes, dreams, and love of two part-names to my name, she would still come for me. She would find me. And she would kill me.
Why did I drink that 
vino
? 


BERKELEY, Calif. – Late Sunday afternoon campus officials responded to reports that freshman Cindy Falseton had been inadvertently stuck to the basement floor of the Berkeley fraternity Pike for over thirty hours. 
“I was stuck in a pool of Bud Light and sweat for thirty hours,” Falseton reported through a trancelike thousand-yard stare. “I heard ‘All Girls Are the Same’ at full volume forty-five times. I don’t know that I’ll ever be able to remove that stain from my ears.”
Fearing a lawsuit from Falseton’s father, who makes a living on emeralds from “somewhere in Africa,” University officials provided Falseton with a psychological evaluation.
“Cindy is shaken up, but she’ll ultimately recover,” explained freshman volunteer and 
Criminal Minds 
fan Karla Almida, who conducted the evaluation. “By my estimate, she’ll be medically fit to return to Pike by their next party: Suits and Sluts. Yeah, she’s exhibiting symptoms similar to those of recently-released prisoners of war but here’s the thing: Cindy has the perfect black crop top for the occasion. She 
deserves 
to make her grand return.”
Brothers were seen traversing the sticky floor with shoes based on houses built on stilts over the water.
“Yeah I didn’t hear her, how could I over the absolute fucking rager we threw?” Pike pledge Connor Jake Chadster told reporters. “She was probably doing it so that she could get a crumb of the Chadster anyway.”
Falseton quickly dismissed Chadster’s accusations.
“Literally nobody noticed me stuck there,” Falseton reported, frustrated but empathetic. “Honestly, it did suck being stuck to this floor for well over 35 hours, but it was worse realizing that these boys live in such squalid conditions and truly cannot care for themselves. Hell, I saw two brothers use DoorDash to get scrambled eggs and a glass of milk.” 
When given the choice between stepping out of her dirty Air Force 1’s or getting her foot sawed off, Falseton chose the latter, stating “if I can’t step out in my Air Forces just take the whole leg.” Falseton will be sad to lose her favorite toe ring. 


LOS ANGELES, Calif. — Last year Lori Loughlin was accused of paying
 $500,000 to get her two daughters, Olivia Jade and Isabella Rose, into USC on a crew scholarship. She has pled not guilty to
fraud, bribery, and money laundering conspiracy 
charges. Up until now, her defense strategy wasn’t going too well. 
“
Ever since the FBI found out I paid, — sorry, let me restart. Ever since the FBI 
accused me 
of paying half a million dollars to get my two daughters into USC, my life has been chaotic. Even though their claim is completely true, I always thought as a rich famous beautiful white woman I was immune to crime. Initially, I assumed the judge was somehow unaware of my celebrity status. Even after informing him that I used to star in Full House, he refused to let me off! The prick actually got angry with me and said that no one
is above the law. I was then sure I got his hint, so I offered him $500,000 to skew the trial towards an innocent conviction, but that just made him even angrier! When did people become so hard to read?! 
I then realized I was targeting the wrong audience. I told the jurors that my daughters both got into USC and that I knew the ins and outs of the college admissions process. Even after offering to teach them a way to get their children into their dream schools, they still weren’t willing to ignore all the facts and find me innocent. All I want is for white wealthy suburban moms with no personality to see me as their role model again. Is that really too much to ask?”
Luckily for Lori, her daughter Olivia came up with a new angle for her defense.
“Ok before I talk about my mom I have to talk about myself because I am more important than anyone else and because I know everyone cares deeply about my life. You know what’s been bugging me? Unoriginal people. Last year I went home from USC after the college admission story broke. A year later everyone copies me and also heads home from college. Like c’mon people, what the hell! Be yourselves. I know I’m basically perfect, but you shouldn’t just copy everything I do. 
My mom has been under a lot of fire for getting me into USC on a crew scholarship even though I haven’t rowed once in my entire life. But let’s be real, in high school I trained just as hard as USC’s team is training right now. I would have been totally fine as a member of their crew team this spring. In fact, I should have been given more of a scholarship than the other athletes because even though I have never done a crew workout before, I have posed for pictures on an ERG machine. That is literally more intense training than what they are doing at the moment. I competed in high school just as much as their freshmen competed in college. Why should my mom be penalized for helping me get a scholarship I deserve?”
Lori is hopeful that this new strategy will help convince the jurors to acquit her. At press time she was complaining that is hard to discuss this new strategy when confined in her $28.7 million six-bedroom Bel-Air mansion. 


BERKELEY, Calif – In an unprecedented move, political economy major and aspiring debate bro Kyle Thebedeau boldly shut the fuck up this Thursday afternoon whilst halfway through an unscripted-but-at-this-point-fairly-predictable rant in his Gender and Capitalism discussion.
“It wasn’t planned,” Thebedeau said of his decision to shut the fuck up (not the rant itself, which was, in fact, planned). “I was in the middle of making my own modest contribution to the class — by which, of course, I mean my completely unsolicited hour-long deep-dive into why the ‘gender pay gap’ isn’t a thing and this one article I found on Reddit proves it – when I suddenly realized I had no idea what I was talking about and should probably just shut the fuck up.”
Instructors rejoiced in Thebedeau’s brave decision.
“Praise the Lord!” exclaimed G&C Professor Claire Leighy, before quickly amending, “Not that I don’t enjoy listening to Kyle speak. I love it when students actively engage with the material. It’s just that I have a hard time presenting the material when Kyle spends the entire lecture period talking about whatever he last heard on Reddit.”
All across the nation, beleaguered male intellectuals are taking inspiration from Thebedeau’s radical act.
“I used to think I had to talk really fast and loudly if I wanted to achieve things like screwing over poor people or stripping women of their reproductive rights,” said 
Daily Wire
 host and notoriously punchable face Benjamin Shapiro. “Now I know that if I just sit still and shut the fuck up, the Supreme Court will do all those things for me! Thanks, Kyle! I never knew it was this easy.”
Other high-profile men who have shut the fuck up in solidarity with Thebedeau include James Franco, former University Chancellor Nicholas Dirks, the MyPillow Guy, Pepé Le Pew, and former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.
Much to the relief of his professors and peers, Thebedeau has indicated that he will continue to shut the fuck up for the remainder of the class period. However, when asked if he would start taking notes, he said “no,” since this would involve him listening to a woman. 


PUNXSUTAWNEY, Pa. —
 A disaster of the girthiest scale struck this morning as the tradition of the most anticipated celebration of the year, Groundhog Day, was broken. The beloved groundhog’s shadow, there to indicate what season soon awaits us, was not seen by anyone today. Unfortunately, his massive, horse cock penis blocked the view. 
The lack of shadow visibility wrought absolute chaos, for how shall we know the weather now? Will there be an early spring? Or will winter persist for six more weeks? The groundhog sees all. But not today. Today, all we saw was one large penis, one that hogged the attention over what the holiday is truly all about: world peace. And the quaint reminder that yes, the jumbled alphabet soup of the town Punxsutawney still exists. 
Punxsutawney Phil, as the groundhog is affectionately known, was asked to comment. His only response was, with a quick glance up and down and a cheeky lip bite, “If you show me your shadow, I’ll show you mine. Ahaha aha.”
Perhaps the message we are left with is not one of tragedy and broken tradition, but rather one of persistence: seasons come and go, but the power of good dick is forever. 
Happy Groundhog Day!


Finding a class in Dwinelle Hall is a UC Berkeley rite of passage. According to legend, sibling rivalry caused two architect brothers to split the design of the building and cobble it together later, resulting in the trauma of tens of thousands of freshmen and upperclassmen alike. The following are some hidden gems that may brighten your spirits the next time you’re hopelessly lost in the building!

What greater treasure than coffee right next door to your 8:00 a.m. discussion? Armed with the rich, luxurious notes of Peet’s from Cal Dining’s Common Grounds on Level F, you will never forget the look on your GSI’s face as you collapse from over-caffeination after 9 back-to-back all-nighters.

Travel down a couple floors to Level B, where you will encounter a private, ethereal arrangement of trees and benches. The gleaming quartz embedded into the stone pavement will almost let you forget the genocide of the Yahi people, whose last member provided the namesake for the courtyard and lived as an object of study in the Hearst Museum during his final years.

On Dwinelle’s mystical 8th floor, you’ll find this gem in plain sight. Can’t find it? Follow the fire.

There is a spot on every floor of Dwinelle where the two halves of the building come together in a dizzying spectacle of elevators, stairwells, and hallways. At the center of this truly breathtaking optical wonder, you can find M. C. Escher’s polyhedron, a gem that’s as illusory as its location.

This next item on the list resides in the office of economics and theology faculty member Dr. Godfrey Ablewhite. Or maybe it’s in a bank in London. Or maybe it’s back in India where it belongs. We saw it in his office briefly but haven’t checked since he disappeared.

I’ll let you in on a secret: Dwinelle is the site of a rift in the space-time continuum caused by the Space Stone forged during the Big Bang. The rift opened a portal to Helsinki that has contributed to the steady decline of Scandinavian majors over the past decade.

Finding this set of gems is not for the faint of heart. Deep in the bowels of Dwinelle, you’ll find the decomposing corpse of Oski’s mother Norma. Not to worry — he shows his undying love for his mom by adopting her personality and lavishing her with expensive gifts funded by the young women who happen to stumble into his motel!

Rumors state that a hoard of precious stones sits at the center of this freshman maze, in the possession of a half-bull, half-human creature employed by the Classics department. The Peach’s efforts to confirm this were unsuccessful, however — the staff writer who volunteered to find the rubies hasn’t been seen in weeks.
